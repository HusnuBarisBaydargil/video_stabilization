# QStab: A Light-weight Video Stabilization Algorithm

This repository contains the official Python implementation for the upcoming article:

**"QStab: A Light-weight Video Stabilization Algorithm Robust to High-Frequency Perturbations"**

QStab provides a simple yet effective approach for stabilizing videos affected by jitter and high-frequency shakiness. The implementation processes an input video, generates a stabilized version, and delivers a quantitative evaluation report comparing the two.

## Features

- Queue-based video stabilization algorithm (`QStab`)
- Real-time, side-by-side visualization of original and stabilized video
- Automatic generation of:
  - `original_video.mp4`
  - `stabilized_video.mp4`
- Automated post-processing pipeline that calculates key evaluation metrics:
  - **Normalized Stability Score (NSS)** ‚Äî Measures reduction in shakiness
  - **Normalized Distortion Score** ‚Äî Assesses content distortion during stabilization
  - **Cropping Ratio** ‚Äî Indicates amount of cropping applied

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## üìÇ Data Download

For reproducibility and evaluation, benchmark video datasets can be downloaded from the following sources:

- **SBMnet Dataset**: [http://pione.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/dataset](http://pione.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/dataset)  
- **NUS Dataset**: [http://liushuaicheng.org/SIGGRAPH2013/database.html](http://liushuaicheng.org/SIGGRAPH2013/database.html)

These datasets can be used to test and compare the performance of the QStab algorithm under different motion scenarios.
